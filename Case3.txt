#MARKET REGIME FILTER#
##still have a few doubts about what exactly is the problem##
###NOTES###

Wth is a MGF???
* dividing market into bearish and bullish somehow?? 
* but why only two classes (a very crude assumption)?? //{multicalssification problem}
* Most importantly why do we even need this?
  Okkay, so we want to design a trading algorithm which is risk-averse/taking depending on the current market regime (bullish/bearish)!

//classification using calender based patterns
- Take top index of the country/or rather top 10-15 stocks and plot them in all the economic cycles historically.
- Manually classify them -> then use a CNN to directly predict from images ->(this can be implemented in an online sense)!!!
- something related to this has already been done like what??( yess every openai and RL gaming world they use images as input)

//classification using NLP can be incorporated in this fs
- Its always in the finance news whats bullish and bearish
- focus on the specific terms and frequency
- real time
- specially brokerage services news(not sure)

// think in more classical ways to do this more in terms of finance/technical indicators etc.
