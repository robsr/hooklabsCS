###MARKET REGIME FILTER###
##still have a few doubts about what exactly is the problem###

Wth is a MGF???
* dividing market into bearish and bullish somehow?? //classification using calender based patterns

 -Take top index of the country/or rather top 10-15 stocks and plot them in all the economic cycles historically.
 -Manually classify them -> then use a CNN to directly predict from images ->(this can be implemented in an online sense)!!!
